# CodeThroughArt - learn how to code using fun and engaging exercises built around creation

NOTE: This is a work in progress 

## What is it?

This project attempts to put together a curriculum for anyone wanting to learn to code. In order to do so we will be using code to create interesting visual effects. The hope is that through the creation of something immediately interesting, the student will stay motivated to learn the basic concepts of programming.

## Required Materials

All that is needed for this course is a computer with a modern web browser (Chrome, Safari, Firefox). All assignments can be done in the P5.js editor:

## Pedagogical Philosophy

The student learns best when there is room to play with what they have learned. By removing as many barriers as possible and allowing for play the learning process can be fun and accelerated. All students are encouraged to take the assignments and expand them in whatever way they find interesting.


## Curriculum

### Day 1: What is programming? Hello world

In this lesson we will get introduced to what it means to program and how to think about programming. We will also make a simple drawing using code.

### Day 2: Variables

In this lesson we will learn the concept of variables and how they are used within a program. This will be done by making a moving animation.

### Day 3: Logic

In this lesson we will start using the computer to make decisions which will affect the drawing we create.

### Day 4: Functions

In this lesson we will learn how to make our code cleaner and more reusable. We will do this by combining the projects from the last three assignments and making them more configurable.

### Day 5: Loops

In this lesson we will learn how to use loops by creating a function which paints gradients. 

### Day 6: TBD, this is still a work in progress and will be updated as we hone the curriculum
